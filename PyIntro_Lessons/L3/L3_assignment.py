"""
Lektion 3 - Control Structures (if/else, loops)
Assignment: Decision Making and Repetition

Instructions:
1. Complete the tasks below to practice control structures
2. Use if/else statements for decision making
3. Use loops for repetition
4. Combine control structures for complex logic
5. Comment your code to explain your logic

This assignment focuses on conditional statements and loops.
"""

# Task 1: Basic Conditional Statements
# TODO: Create a program that asks for the user's age
# TODO: Use if/else to determine if they can vote (18+)
# TODO: Add elif statements for different age categories (child, teen, adult, senior)
# TODO: Print appropriate messages for each category

# Task 2: Comparison and Logical Operators
# TODO: Create a program that asks for two numbers
# TODO: Compare them using different operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
# TODO: Use logical operators (and, or, not) to create complex conditions
# TODO: Print the results of your comparisons

# Task 3: Nested Conditionals
# TODO: Create a program that determines the season based on month
# TODO: Use nested if statements to handle edge cases
# TODO: Add validation to ensure the month is between 1-12
# TODO: Handle invalid input gracefully

# Task 4: For Loops
# TODO: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
# TODO: Use a for loop to print each number
# TODO: Use a for loop to calculate the sum of all numbers
# TODO: Use a for loop to find the largest number in a list
# TODO: Use a for loop to print the multiplication table for a given number

# Task 5: While Loops
# TODO: Create a counter that counts from 1 to 10 using a while loop
# TODO: Create a program that asks for numbers until the user enters 0
# TODO: Keep track of how many numbers were entered
# TODO: Calculate the average of all entered numbers
# TODO: Create a simple guessing game using a while loop

# Task 6: Loop Control (break, continue)
# TODO: Create a program that prints numbers 1-20
# TODO: Use break to stop when you reach 15
# TODO: Use continue to skip even numbers
# TODO: Create a program that asks for input until a specific word is entered

# Task 7: Nested Loops
# TODO: Create a program that prints a multiplication table (1-10)
# TODO: Use nested loops to create a pattern (e.g., stars or numbers)
# TODO: Create a program that finds all prime numbers between 1-50
# TODO: Use nested loops to create a simple ASCII art pattern

# Task 8: List Comprehensions
# TODO: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20
# TODO: Use list comprehension to create a list of even numbers
# TODO: Use list comprehension to create a list of squares
# TODO: Use list comprehension to create a list of strings from numbers

# Task 9: String Processing with Loops
# TODO: Create a program that counts vowels in a string
# TODO: Create a program that reverses a string
# TODO: Create a program that checks if a string is a palindrome
# TODO: Create a program that counts the frequency of each letter in a string

# Task 10: Practical Applications
# TODO: Create a simple calculator that can perform multiple operations
# TODO: Use loops to allow the user to perform multiple calculations
# TODO: Add a menu system with options
# TODO: Allow the user to exit the program

# Task 11: Error Handling with Control Structures
# TODO: Create a program that asks for a number
# TODO: Use try-except to handle invalid input
# TODO: Use loops to keep asking until valid input is provided
# TODO: Create a robust input validation system

# Task 12: Complex Logic
# TODO: Create a program that simulates a simple ATM
# TODO: Ask for account balance and transaction type
# TODO: Use conditionals to handle different transaction types
# TODO: Use loops to allow multiple transactions
# TODO: Add validation for insufficient funds

# Bonus Challenge:
# TODO: Create a "Number Guessing Game" that:
# - Generates a random number between 1-100
# - Asks the user to guess the number
# - Provides hints (too high, too low)
# - Keeps track of the number of guesses
# - Allows the user to play again
# - Uses appropriate control structures throughout

print("Excellent work! You've mastered control structures!")
print("You can now create programs that make decisions and repeat actions!")
print("Ready for the next challenge: functions and modules!")
