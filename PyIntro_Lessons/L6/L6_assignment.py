Lektion 6 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Part 1
Assignment: Creating Your First Classes

Instructions:
1. Complete the tasks below to practice object-oriented programming
2. Create classes with attributes and methods
3. Understand the concept of objects and instances
4. Practice encapsulation and data hiding
5. Comment your code to explain your design decisions

This assignment introduces the fundamentals of OOP in Python.
"""

# Task 1: Basic Class Creation
# TODO: Create a class called Person with attributes for name and age
# TODO: Add a method to display the person's information
# TODO: Create instances of the Person class
# TODO: Call the display method on your instances

# Task 2: Constructor and Instance Variables
# TODO: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes for account_number and balance
# TODO: Use __init__ to initialize the account
# TODO: Add methods to deposit and withdraw money
# TODO: Add a method to display the account balance
# TODO: Create multiple bank accounts and test the methods

# Task 3: Class Variables and Methods
# TODO: Create a class called Student with class variables for school_name and total_students
# TODO: Add instance variables for name, student_id, and grades
# TODO: Create a class method to get the total number of students
# TODO: Add a method to calculate the student's GPA
# TODO: Test your class with multiple students

# Task 4: Encapsulation and Properties
# TODO: Create a class called Temperature with a private attribute _celsius
# TODO: Add properties to get and set the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit
# TODO: Add validation to ensure temperature is within reasonable bounds
# TODO: Create a method to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
# TODO: Test your class with different temperature values

# Task 5: Method Overloading and Special Methods
# TODO: Create a class called Vector with x and y coordinates
# TODO: Implement __str__ and __repr__ methods
# TODO: Implement __add__ and __sub__ methods for vector addition and subtraction
# TODO: Implement __eq__ method to compare vectors
# TODO: Implement __len__ method to return the magnitude of the vector
# TODO: Test all the special methods

# Task 6: Inheritance - Basic
# TODO: Create a base class called Animal with attributes for name and species
# TODO: Add methods to make_sound() and move()
# TODO: Create derived classes Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal
# TODO: Override the make_sound() method in each derived class
# TODO: Create instances of Dog and Cat and test the methods

# Task 7: Inheritance - Advanced
# TODO: Create a base class called Vehicle with attributes for make, model, and year
# TODO: Add methods to start_engine() and stop_engine()
# TODO: Create derived classes Car, Motorcycle, and Truck
# TODO: Add specific attributes and methods to each derived class
# TODO: Create a method to display vehicle information

# Task 8: Composition vs Inheritance
# TODO: Create a class called Engine with attributes for horsepower and fuel_type
# TODO: Create a class called Car that uses an Engine object (composition)
# TODO: Create a class called ElectricCar that also uses an Engine object
# TODO: Compare composition vs inheritance approaches
# TODO: Test both approaches with different scenarios

# Task 9: Abstract Base Classes
# TODO: Create an abstract base class called Shape with abstract methods
# TODO: Create concrete classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle
# TODO: Implement the abstract methods in each concrete class
# TODO: Create a function that works with any Shape object
# TODO: Test your abstract base class and concrete implementations

# Task 10: Class Decorators and Metaclasses
# TODO: Create a decorator that adds a timestamp to class methods
# TODO: Create a decorator that validates method parameters
# TODO: Apply decorators to your existing classes
# TODO: Test the decorated methods
# TODO: Explore the concept of metaclasses (advanced)

# Task 11: Practical Application - Library System
# TODO: Create a class called Book with attributes for title, author, and ISBN
# TODO: Create a class called Library with a collection of books
# TODO: Add methods to add, remove, and search for books
# TODO: Add methods to check out and return books
# TODO: Create a class called Member to represent library members
# TODO: Implement a simple library management system

# Task 12: Error Handling in Classes
# TODO: Add error handling to your BankAccount class
# TODO: Handle insufficient funds when withdrawing
# TODO: Handle invalid account numbers
# TODO: Create custom exception classes for your domain
# TODO: Test error handling with various scenarios

# Task 13: Class Documentation and Testing
# TODO: Add docstrings to all your classes and methods
# TODO: Create test cases for your classes
# TODO: Test edge cases and error conditions
# TODO: Create a simple test framework for your classes
# TODO: Document the design decisions and trade-offs

# Task 14: Design Patterns
# TODO: Implement the Singleton pattern for a configuration class
# TODO: Implement the Factory pattern for creating different types of vehicles
# TODO: Implement the Observer pattern for a simple event system
# TODO: Test your design pattern implementations
# TODO: Explain when and why to use each pattern

# Bonus Challenge:
# TODO: Create a "Class Library" that includes:
# - A comprehensive set of classes for a specific domain (e.g., gaming, finance, education)
# - Proper inheritance hierarchies
# - Abstract base classes where appropriate
# - Error handling and validation
# - Comprehensive documentation
# - A demonstration program that shows all classes in action
# - Unit tests for all classes

print("Excellent! You've mastered the fundamentals of object-oriented programming!")
print("You can now create well-structured, reusable, and maintainable code!")
print("Ready for the next challenge: advanced OOP concepts!")
